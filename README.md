### How do I get this running?

First, you'll need a ZX Spectrum emulator, like [Fuse](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/). Versions are available for Mac, Linux and PC.

Next, download the binary TAP (tape) file

* [GoodShepherd.tap](https://github.com/paulspringett/GoodShepherd/raw/v1.0/GoodShepherd.tap)

and load this into the emulator. Then type `RUN` (the emulator may autocomplete `R` to `RUN`) and press `ENTER`.
